# Tic-Tac-Toe-game-bot
Tic Tac Toe game bot using python (coded in portuguese language for a University project)

Welcome!

I made this project for a class called Programming Fundamentals using Python, during the first year of my Computer Science and Engineering degree.

The bot has 3 levels ('basico' which is the most basic, 'normal' which is the medium difficulty and 'perfeito' which is the hardest and impossible to beat (only to draw)).

The code and all the comments inside the project are all made in Portuguese.

Hope you enjoyed it!

Best wishes,
Nuno Martins
